console.log("Hi! Arbaz, This is javascript");
console.log(

);

// console.log(alert("hello")); // This will display an alert box with the message "hello" in it. but why -> because console.log() is used to print the message to the console.

// console.log(window); // window is not defined -> it is a global object in the browser environment. It is not available in Node.js environment.
